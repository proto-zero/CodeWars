# Code Wars

## alphabet_war

Write a function that accepts fight string consists of only small letters and return who wins the fight. When the left side wins return Left side wins!, when the right side wins return Right side wins!, in other case return Let's fight again!.

The left side letters and their power:
 w - 4
 p - 3
 b - 2
 s - 1

The right side letters and their power:
 m - 4
 q - 3
 d - 2
 z - 1

The other letters don't have power and are only victims.

Example
AlphabetWar("z");        //=> Right side wins!
AlphabetWar("zdqmwpbs"); //=> Let's fight again!
AlphabetWar("zzzzs");    //=> Right side wins!
AlphabetWar("wwwwwwz");  //=> Left side wins!

## alphabet_war_II.rb

Write a function that accepts fight string consists of only small letters and return who wins the fight. When the left side wins return Left side wins!, when the right side wins return Right side wins!, in other case return Let's fight again!.

The left side letters and their power:
 w - 4
 p - 3
 b - 2
 s - 1
 t - 0 (but it's priest with Wo lo loooooooo power)

The right side letters and their power:
 m - 4
 q - 3
 d - 2
 z - 1
 j - 0 (but it's priest with Wo lo loooooooo power)

The other letters don't have power and are only victims.
The priest units t and j change the adjacent letters from hostile letters to friendly letters with the same power.
mtq => wtp
wjs => mjz

A letter with adjacent letters j and t is not converted i.e.:
tmj => tmj
jzt => jzt

The priests (j and t) do not convert the other priests ( jt => jt ).

Example
AlphabetWar("z")         //=>  "z"  => "Right side wins!"
AlphabetWar("tz")        //=>  "ts" => "Left side wins!"
AlphabetWar("jz")        //=>  "jz" => "Right side wins!"
AlphabetWar("zt")        //=>  "st" => "Left side wins!"
AlphabetWar("azt")       //=> "ast" => "Left side wins!"
AlphabetWar("tzj")       //=> "tzj" => "Right side wins!"

## break_camel_case.rb

Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.

Example
"camelCasing"  =>  "camel Casing"
"identifier"   =>  "identifier"
""             =>  ""

## categorize_new_members

The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

Input
Input will consist of a list of lists containing two items each. Each list contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

Note for F#: The input will be of (int list list) which is a List<List>

Example Input
[[18, 20],[45, 2],[61, 12],[37, 6],[21, 21],[78, 9]]
Output
Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

Example Output
["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

## consecutive_strings.rb

You are given an array(list) strarr of strings and an integer k. Your task is to return the first longest string consisting of k consecutive strings taken in the array.

Examples:
strarr = ["tree", "foling", "trashy", "blue", "abcdef", "uvwxyz"], k = 2

Concatenate the consecutive strings of strarr by 2, we get:

treefoling   (length 10)  concatenation of strarr[0] and strarr[1]
folingtrashy ("      12)  concatenation of strarr[1] and strarr[2]
trashyblue   ("      10)  concatenation of strarr[2] and strarr[3]
blueabcdef   ("      10)  concatenation of strarr[3] and strarr[4]
abcdefuvwxyz ("      12)  concatenation of strarr[4] and strarr[5]

Two strings are the longest: "folingtrashy" and "abcdefuvwxyz".
The first that came is "folingtrashy" so
longest_consec(strarr, 2) should return "folingtrashy".

In the same way:
longest_consec(["zone", "abigail", "theta", "form", "libe", "zas", "theta", "abigail"], 2) --> "abigailtheta"
n being the length of the string array, if n = 0 or k > n or k <= 0 return "".

Note
consecutive strings : follow one after another without an interruption

## convert_PascalCase_string_into_snake_case.rb

Complete the function/method so that it takes CamelCase string and returns the string in snake_case notation. Lowercase characters can be numbers. If method gets number, it should return string.

Examples:

returns test_controller
to_underscore('TestController')

returns movies_and_books
to_underscore('MoviesAndBooks')

returns app7_test
to_underscore('App7Test')

returns "1"
to_underscore(1)

## count_by_x.rb

Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first (n) multiples of (x).

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).

Examples:

count_by(1,10) #should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
count_by(2,5) #should return [2,4,6,8,10]

## detect_pangram.rb

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

## first_non-repeating_character.rb

Write a function named first_non_repeating_letter that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.

For example, if given the input 'stress', the function should return 't', since the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.

As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter. For example, the input 'sTreSS' should return 'T'.

If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return an empty string ("") or None -- see sample tests.

## format_a_string_of_names.rb

Description:
Given: an array containing hashes of names

Return: a string formatted as a list of names separated by commas except for the last two names, which should be separated by an ampersand.

Example:

list([ {name: 'Bart'}, {name: 'Lisa'}, {name: 'Maggie'} ])
# returns 'Bart, Lisa & Maggie'

list([ {name: 'Bart'}, {name: 'Lisa'} ])
# returns 'Bart & Lisa'

list([ {name: 'Bart'} ])
# returns 'Bart'

list([])
# returns ''

## new_cashier.rb

Some new cashiers started to work at your restaurant.

They are good at taking orders, but they don't know how to capitalize words, or use a space bar!

All the orders they create look something like this:

"milkshakepizzachickenfriescokeburgerpizzasandwichmilkshakepizza"

The kitchen staff are threatening to quit, because of how difficult it is to read the orders.

Their preference is to get the orders as a nice clean string with spaces and capitals like so:

"Burger Fries Chicken Pizza Pizza Pizza Sandwich Milkshake Milkshake Coke"

The kitchen staff expect the items to be in the same order as they appear in the menu.

The menu items are fairly simple, there is no overlap in the names of the items:

1. Burger
2. Fries
3. Chicken
4. Pizza
5. Sandwich
6. Onionrings
7. Milkshake
8. Coke

## plus_one_array.rb

Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value represented by the array.

the array can't be empty
only non-negative, single digit integers are allowed
Return nil (or your language's equivalent) for invalid inputs.

Examples
For example the array [2, 3, 9] equals 239, adding one would return the array [2, 4, 0].

[4, 3, 2, 5] would return [4, 3, 2, 6]

## range_extraction.rb

A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either

individual integers
or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'. The range includes all integers in the interval including both endpoints. It is not considered a range unless it spans at least 3 numbers. For example "12,13,15-17"
Complete the solution so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order and returns a correctly formatted string in the range format.

Example:

solution([-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20])
# returns "-6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20"

## sum_of_digits.rb

Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

Examples
    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2

## valid_parentheses.rb

Write a function that takes a string of parentheses, and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid. The function should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

Examples
"()"              =>  true
")(()))"          =>  false
"("               =>  false
"(())((()())())"  =>  true

Constraints
0 <= input.length <= 100

Along with opening (() and closing ()) parenthesis, input may contain any valid ASCII characters. Furthermore, the input string may be empty and/or not contain any parentheses at all. Do not treat other forms of brackets as parentheses (e.g. [], {}, <>).


## which_are_in

Given two arrays of strings a1 and a2 return a sorted array r in lexicographical order of the strings of a1 which are substrings of strings of a2.

Example 1:
a1 = ["arp", "live", "strong"]

a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]

returns ["arp", "live", "strong"]

Example 2:
a1 = ["tarp", "mice", "bull"]

a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]

returns []

Notes:
Arrays are written in "general" notation. See "Your Test Cases" for examples in your language.
In Shell bash a1 and a2 are strings. The return is a string where words are separated by commas.
Beware: r must be without duplicates.

## your_order_please.rb

Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.

Examples
"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
"4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"
""  -->  ""
